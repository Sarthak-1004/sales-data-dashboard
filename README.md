# sales-data-dashboard
📌 Project Overview

  This project provides a messy dataset of 2000+ rows and 10+ columns with real-world challenges such as:

  1. Missing values

  2. Duplicate entries

  3. Inconsistent formatting

  4. Outliers

 - The goal is to practice data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.

🎯 Objectives

 1. Handle missing values (mean/median imputation, forward fill, etc.)

 2. Remove or treat duplicate records

 3. Standardize categorical values (e.g., gender, section, etc.)

 4. Detect and manage outliers

 5. Generate meaningful insights with visualization

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

 1. Python

 2. Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation

 3. NumPy – numerical operations

 4. Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization & insights

📂 Dataset

 File: sales_dataset.csv

 - Rows: 2000+

 - Columns: 10+

 - Contains missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues for practice.
